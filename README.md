# coding-helpdesk

_Live support by appointment_

The goal of this repository is to provide infrastructure to support 2DII's coding helpdesk. We'll try it during until the end of May 2020. This is an opportunity for you to schedule a 30' appointment to work live with someone else on whatever coding problem you have. 

The coding-helpdesk complements the more informal support you can get anytime at 2DII's slack workspace on the channel #coding. It is more intentional and useful because:
* it forces you to prepare and explain what your problem is, which brings you closer to the solution;
* it forces you and your helper to focus on your problem without distraction or interruption;
* it facilitates the transfer of knowledge in both directions between you and your helper.



## How to schedule an appointment

1. Login to google calendar with your 2DII email.
2. Add the calendars of all helpers (list below).
3. Search for "helpdesk" and identify a suitable time slot and helper.
4. Use the email icon or Description field to describe what help you need.
