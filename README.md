# coding-helpdesk

_Live support by appointment_

The goal of this repository is to provide infrastructure to support 2dii's coding helpdesk that we'll try from now until the end of May. This is an opportunity for you to schedule a 30' appointment to work live with someone else on whatever coding problem you have. 

This complements the more informal support you can get anytime at 2dii's slack workspace on the channel #coding. We hope the limitations that this project imposes will benefit you and you helper by:

* forcing you to articulate what your problem is, which moves you a long way towards actually solving the problem;
* forcing you and your helper to focus on your problem without distraction or interruption;
* facilitating the transfer of knowledge in both directions between you and your helper.



## How to schedule an appointment

1. Login with your 2dii username to google chalendar.

2. Add the calendars of all helpers (e.g. add mauro@2degrees-investing.org, cj@2degrees-investing.org, and jackson@2degrees-investing.org).

3. Search for "helpdesk" and identify a suitable time-slot and helper.

4. Create a google calendar event on that time-slot and invite that helper.



## How to prepare

If possible, create a reproduble example with the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/).
