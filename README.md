# coding-helpdesk

The goal of this repository is to provide infrastructure to support 2DII's
coding helpdesk. This is an opportunity for you to schedule a 30' appointment
to work live with someone else on whatever coding problem you have.

The coding-helpdesk complements the more informal support you can get anytime
at 2DII's slack workspace on the channel #coding. It is more intentional
and useful because:

* it forces you to prepare and explain what your problem is, which brings
you closer to the solution;
* it forces you and your helper to focus on your problem without distraction
or interruption;
* it facilitates the transfer of knowledge in both directions between you
and your helper.



## How to schedule an appointment

1. Login to google calendar with your 2DII email.
2. Add the calendars of all [helpers](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/coding-helpdesk#helpers).
3. Search for "helpdesk" and identify a suitable time slot and helper.
4. Use the email icon or Description field to describe what help you need.
